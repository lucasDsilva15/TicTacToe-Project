## How To Play

https://lucasdsilva15.github.io/TicTacToe-Project/ you can use this link to view the finished product.

## Tech 

JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## How it works

We basically have an array Board State which will fill up with X's and O's. As this array updates after every turn we have a check win function that will repeadetly check if the the winner has won based of a data set filled with all possible win conditions. If a win condition is met the game ends and the score is updated. Hitting the reset button will allow you to play again.

## Features
Be able to play against another player by your side, or a computer that automatically plays along with you. The bot is not challenging (yet) however is a great showcase
of how complex you can get using JavaScript to update your web page.

## How to play
Select on the start screen if you would like to play against a player or computer, once selected it is a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe, first to get 3 in a row in any
direction will win. Once you've won you can click reset on the bottom left to reset your board and refer to the scoreboard to keep track of wins, loses, and draws.

If you would like to change which mode you'd like to play simply refresh the page.

## Information
This project was made for our first large project for PerScholas bootcamp. This project was able to display basic css and html knowledge and large use of JavaScript
DOM-manipulation. While making this project some of the techincal difficulties were creating the computer that plays against the player. Using two seperate arrays to
update the board and the computers choices were exteremly challenging but a great learning experience. Also creating a data set that checks each win condition
was very helpful in learning how to use data sets in the future. 

## Future Updates
Adding higher difficulties for the computer that will have more intelligent logic.
